###### My favorite Museum to visit is Salar Jung Museum <br>
This Museum has a collection of paintings,carvings and manuscripts <br>
One of the interesting thing is that it has reference library <br>
**It is one of the largest Museams in the world**<br>
**Museum also has a collection of modern Indian artworks**
